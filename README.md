# Belt Turner
Turns belts automatically when pasting multiple belt lane blueprints.
![](mod-portal/relative_gui.png)

## Motivation
1. When routing multiple lanes of belts I always just blueprint a straight section of belt and drag that, but that doesn't play nicely with corners so I have to manually fix a corner and then copy/paste (and potentially flip!) that corner to all the other turns I did on the belt.
2. Using this belt turner mod, I can just copy/paste the straight section of multiple belt lanes through corners and it gets automatically fixed.

## Features
1. Paste belt blueprints on top of belts to change the direction of the belts at the corner.
