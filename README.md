# Quick Chest Limit
Set chest limits with one clicks for common limit amounts. For common limits, this is quicker and less error-prone than setting the limit by clicking the red button, and then moving the cursor to the desired limit location and clicking again.

## Motivation
1. This is mostly because https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=109212&p=594162 was not a bug but is still cumbersome UI. For me personally it's still too slow and easy to make the mistake mentioned in that forum thread when needing to configure a bunch of chest limits when working with passive provider chests that would be way too large of a buffer if allowed to fill completely. So this mod exists so I don't have to use the vanilla chest limit UI and hopefully you don't have to either.

## Features
1. Tiny GUI to the side of the chest that has buttons for setting chest limits with one click.
2. Click any button in the slots row to set the limit to that number of slots.
3. Click any button in the rows row to set the limit to that number of rows.
4. Click the clear limit button to remove the set chest limit.
